▓    As I promised, here I provide the source code for ACDSee32 v1.x       ▓█
█▓    and v2.x.                                                             ▓█
█▓                                                                          ▓█
█▓    Well known to all cracker, ACDSee32 uses a very creative, original,   ▓█
█▓    and complicated registration system, which seems the only solution    ▓█
█▓    to write a keymaker is to brute force it.                             ▓█
█▓                                                                          ▓█
█▓    This keymaker was written in 1997 when I was in PCE and was adapted   ▓█
█▓    for changes in ACDSee v2.3+ in 1999 in CORE.                          ▓█
█▓                                                                          ▓█
█▓    Study the source code by yourself, I will not give any further        ▓█
█▓    comments on this project.                                             ▓█
█▓                                                                          ▓█
█▓    ACDSee32 v2.x is now outdated, that's why I released this source      ▓█
█▓    code.                                                                 ▓█
